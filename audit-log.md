# NoSpaces Shell Script Utility Audit Log

## Project Description
NoSpaces is a shell script utility designed to clean up filenames by replacing spaces with underscores, removing single and double quotes, and setting appropriate file permissions (777). The tool includes safety features such as preventing overwriting of existing files and requiring user confirmation before renaming.

## Technical Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux-based systems
- **Permissions**: Requires sudo access for global installation
- **Dependencies**: No external dependencies beyond core utilities

**Note**: This utility has been extensively tested in Ubuntu 22.04 running in Windows WSL2 environment and is confirmed to work reliably in this configuration.
